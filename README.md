# SJSON CPP

`sjson-cpp` is a C++ library to read and write [SJSON](http://help.autodesk.com/view/Stingray/ENU/?guid=__stingray_help_managing_content_sjson_html) files.
It aims to be minimal, fast, and get out of the way of the programmer.

By design, the reader/parser does no memory allocations.

Everything is 100% C++ header based for easy and trivial integration.
